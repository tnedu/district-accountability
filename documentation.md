## District Accountability Model

This page outlines our model for district accountability beginning summer 2018.

### Minimum Performance Goal

|                  |      Achievement     |   Value-Added  |   Super Subgroup Below Reduction   |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| 3-5 Success Rate | % O/M > Prior Year  | TVAAS Level 3+ |       % Below < Prior Year        |
| 6-8 Success Rate | % O/M > Prior Year  | TVAAS Level 3+ |       % Below < Prior Year        |
|  HS Success Rate | % O/M > Prior Year  | TVAAS Level 3+ |       % Below < Prior Year        |

% O/M comparisons to prior year allow for an upper bound CI and % Below comparisons allow for a lower bound CI.

Districts must pass at least one content area for each key. A district failing all three content areas for any key OR failing to meet a 95% participation rate in any content area receives a final designation of In Need of Improvement.

### Achievement

For 3-5 Success Rate, 6-8 Success Rate, High School Success Rate, indicators map to points as follows:

|          | Absolute Achievement |                 AMO Target               |   Value-Added  |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 4 Points |    Top Quintile      |                12.5% Growth              | Level 5 TVAAS  |
| 3 Points |    2nd Quintile      |                6.25% Growth              | Level 4 TVAAS  |
| 2 Points |    3rd Quintile      |      6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI      | Level 3 TVAAS  |
| 1 Points |    4th Quintile      |     < 6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI     | Level 2 TVAAS  |
| 0 Points |    Bottom Quintile   |        Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year      | Level 1 TVAAS  |

For Absenteeism, indicators map to points as follows:

|          | Absolute Absenteeism |          Reduction AMO Target       |   Value-Added  |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| 4 Points |    Top Quintile      |          12.5% Reduction            | Top Quintile Reduction based on Student Match |
| 3 Points |    2nd Quintile      |          6.25% Reduction            | 2nd Quintile Reduction based on Student Match |
| 2 Points |    3rd Quintile      |   6.25% Reduction w/ Lower Bound CI | 3rd Quintile Reduction based on Student Match |
| 1 Points |    4th Quintile      | < 6.25% Reduction w/ Upper Bound CI | 4th Quintile Reduction based on Student Match |
| 0 Points |    Bottom Quintile   |    Lower Bound CI >= Prior Year   | Bottom Quintile Reduction based on Student Match |

For Graduation Rate, indicators map to points as follows:

|          |    Absolute Grad     |                 AMO Target               |   Value-Added  |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 4 Points |    Top Quintile      |                12.5% Growth              | Top Quintile Change in Ready Graduates |
| 3 Points |    2nd Quintile      |                6.25% Growth              | 2nd Quintile Change in Ready Graduates |
| 2 Points |    3rd Quintile      |      6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI      | 3rd Quintile Change in Ready Graduates |
| 1 Points |    4th Quintile      |     < 6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI     | 4th Quintile Change in Ready Graduates |
| 0 Points |    Bottom Quintile   |        Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year      | Bottom Quintile Change in Ready Graduates |

For the value added pathway, Ready Graduates is (% ACT 21+ * Graduation Rate).

For ELPA, indicators map to points as follows:

|          |    Percent Exit      |  AMO Target (% Meeting Growth Standard)  |  Value-Added   |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 4 Points |    Top Quintile      |                12.5% Growth              |  |
| 3 Points |    2nd Quintile      |                6.25% Growth              |  |
| 2 Points |    3rd Quintile      |      6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI      |  |
| 1 Points |    4th Quintile      |     < 6.25% Growth w/ Upper Bound CI     |  |
| 0 Points |    Bottom Quintile   |        Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year      |  |

Percent Exit is weighted based on time in ESL services.

The score for each content area is the average of 1) the best of the Absolute and AMO scores and 2) the Value-Added score. Average across content areas to produce an overall achievement score.

Achievement scores map to a designation as follows:

* 0 = In Need of Improvement
* (0, 1] = Marginal
* (1, 2] = Satisfactory
* (2, 3] = Advancing
* (3, 4] = Exemplary

### Subgroup

Indicators map to points as in Achievement. Calculate a subgroup average for each subgroup, then average subgroup averages to produce an overall subgroup score. Subgroup scores map to a designation as with achievement:

* 0 = In Need of Improvement
* (0, 1] = Marginal
* (1, 2] = Satisfactory
* (2, 3] = Advancing
* (3, 4] = Exemplary

### Final Designation

A district's overall achievement and subgroup scores are weighted (60% achievement, 40% subgroup) and averaged to produce an overall average. The overall average maps to a final grade as follows:

* Fail Minimum Performance = In Need of Improvement
* [0, 1] = Marginal
* (1, 2] = Satisfactory
* (2, 3] = Advancing
* (3, 4] = Exemplary
